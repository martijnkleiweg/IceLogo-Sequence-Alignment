# IceLogo-Sequence-Alignment

As a research assistant at the Phenotyping Core of the University of Arizona, I created Python scripts for amino acid Icelogo sequence alignment tasks. This is one example. Data extracting and cleaning is excluded.

Icelogo is a web service for visualising conserved patterns in protein and nucleotide sequences through probability theory.

UniProt is a freely accessible database of protein sequence and functional information, many entries being derived from genome sequencing projects. It contains a large amount of information about the biological function of proteins derived from the research literature.
