# IceLogo-Sequence-Alignment

As a research assistant at the Phenotyping Core of the University of Arizona, I created Python scripts for amino acid Icelogo sequence alignment tasks. This is one example. Data extracting and cleaning is exluded.

Icelogo is a web service for visualising conserved patterns in protein and nucleotide sequences through probability theory.
